This is going to be a point of sale system that when you press the menu item, it makes a receipt and totals your bill and adds tax.

I was having a big struggle this weekend getting things to work and making sense of stuff but I got a little help and got most of it working. I just need to fix the total so it and then calculate the tax and compile grand total. I had my jquery link in the wrong place in my html which was causing things to load before so everything I typed was erroring out which confused me most of the weekend.
